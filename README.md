# **Human Number Guessing ML Game ðŸŽ²ðŸ§ **  

This is a simple **machine learning-based number guessing game** that improves over time by learning from user inputs! ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š  

## **How It Works**  
1. The program asks you to think of a number between **1 and 10**.  
2. It attempts to guess your number in **3 tries**, based on past user data.  
3. If the guess is wrong, it refines future predictions by learning from your response.  
4. The game stores user guesses in a JSON file, ensuring it gets **smarter over time**!  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Adaptive Learning** â€“ The more people play, the better the guesses become!  
âœ… **Data Persistence** â€“ Past guesses are stored in `human-guesses-dataset.json`.  
âœ… **Simple & Fun** â€“ A lightweight Python project with interactive gameplay.  

## **Installation & Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-number-guessing-ml-game.git
   ```
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python guess_game.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and see if the ML algorithm can guess your number!
